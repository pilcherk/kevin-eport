      <h2>Enhancing Motivation in the U.S. Air Force (SWOT)</h2>
      <p>
        This paper provides a risk analysis of cultural and procedural challenges when implementing motivational initiatives in the U.S. Air Force. It identifies three major risks—cultural differences, resistance to change, and rigid procedures—and offers mitigation strategies for each. The aim is to help the Air Force stay agile, cohesive, and effective in its leadership and operational performance.
